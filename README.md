# Noteable

**Noteable** is a simple, user-friendly web app that allows users to create, manage, and organize notes. Think of it as a minimalistic version of Google Keep, designed to help users capture and manage their thoughts quickly. This project demonstrates my ability to work with design systems and implement a clean, intuitive user interface.

    - **Panda CSS** (a utility-first CSS framework used for custom design)
    - **Ark-UI** (for accessible and reusable components)

- **Backend (optional)**:

    - You can use **Node.js** and **Express** if you're planning to add a backend for storing notes.

- **Deployment**:
    - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (for easy deployment of the frontend)
